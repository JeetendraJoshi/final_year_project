# Hate Speech Detection and Hate Network Detection on Social Media
 
This repository contains the main deliverables and software designed to produce the results seen in my MEng Final Year Project thesis for titled: **"Hate Speech Detection and Hate Network Detection on Social Media"**.

## Project Abstract
This project concerns the research and design of a hate speech detection model that could identify the hate speech from social media. This further leads into the development of a hateful network detector on the Twitter platform. K-NNs, transformer and GRU algorithms have been used with varying sets of tweets of data to determine hate speech classification with varying success. Work was also done to determine the effect of preprocessing on the effectiveness of a model. Extensive testing was then conducted comparing varying models and using the best performing models to successfully perform hate network detection on Twitter.
